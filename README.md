5.  Merge "feature-b" into main. While you were working on your branch, other devs may have merged their work into the main branch, so before merging your code, you should try to get the latest version.

    a. What commands would you use and why?  
I would use the command <git pull> to have locally all the recently changes from others dev and prevent possible conflict.
